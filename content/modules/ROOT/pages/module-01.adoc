= Sign up for the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Cloud Service Free Trial and Deploy your Instance

To get started with the ACS CS free trial your Red Hat rep told you about you need to sign up at Red Hat's customer portal. The trial gives you 60 days to try the product across all your environments!

So, your first step is to get signed up to the trial so you can use it with your existing ROSA and CandleCo's EKS cluster.
