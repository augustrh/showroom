= Deploy Central via the Red Hat Console.

Achieve faster time to value by quickly deploying Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes as a fully managed Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that reduces costly maintenance and management activity. With no infrastructure to manage, security operators can instead focus on risk reduction and incident triage.

== Deploy the Central Instance

Next you will launch the actual ACS CS instance within the Red Hat Console. For the trial this is entirely hosted in a Red Hat account with no cost to you!

== Launch the instance of ACS CS

*Please prefix your Central instance name with "summit". i.e. "summit-central".*

. Click on Create Instance.

. Click on Create ACS Instance.

. Choose a name for your Central instance (cannot have spaces, special characters, or capitals). Please prefix your Central instance name with "jam". i.e. "jam-central".

. Click create instance.

_Note: Deployment time may take around 15-20 minutes. Monitor the Red Hat Console for ACS provisioning status:_

*Once your ACS CS instance is provisioning please let the proctors know as we will do a small presentation while we all wait for our instances to provision.*
