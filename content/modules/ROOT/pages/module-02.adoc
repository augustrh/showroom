= Deploy Central via the Red Hat Console.

<<<Text about what this is>>>

== Deploy the Central Instance

Next you will launch the actual ACS CS instance within the Red Hat Console. For the trial this is entirely hosted in a Red Hat account with no cost to you!

*Please prefix your Central instance name with "jam". i.e. "jam-central".*

_Note: Deployment time may take around 15-20 minutes. Monitor the Red Hat Console for ACS provisioning status:_
