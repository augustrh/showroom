= Identify and act on a vulnerable deployment

Now let's see how you can identity a vulnerable deployment and stop it in its tracks.

== Identity the affected deployment

Candleco has a cryptominer in one of its deployments. To find it go to Violations in the ACS console and search for viloations that have been detetced by the Cryptocurrency Mining Process policy.

Use the "Filter violations" dialog to easily find all deployments with the vioaltion.

We can see now the deployment that has the violation ("candleco-images-deployment")

== Viewing the violation

Click on the "Cryptocurrency mining process spawned" heading for the candleco-images-deployment in "myEKS/candleco"

Here you can see a lot of interesting details about the violation. Click through the tabs to see what you can learn.

Look particularily at the "Deployment" tab. Here we can see that this violation is actually part of a RUNNING deployment in our cluster. That's not good!

Let's view that from the EKS side; return to Cloud9 and view the deployments:

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl get deployments -n candleco
----

You'll see that it's running! We need to stop that and we can use ACS to do just that.

== Configure the policy to act on a violation

Right now, all ACS has done is tell us we have a violation. But we can also have it address that violation. To do this we need to edit the Cryptominer policy settings.

Go to Platform Configuration > Policy Managament and Filter for the Cryptominer Policy:

image::task8-b.png[task8-b]

Choose the 3 dots at the end of the line and select "Edit policy":

image::task8-c.png[task8-c]

Go to the "Policy behavior" section and find the "Response method" option:

image::task8-e.png[task8-e]

The response can be one of the following:

*Inform: Policy violations generate a violation in the violations list.

*Inform and enforce: The violation is enforced.

Choosing "Inform and enforce" will reveal more options (you may need to scroll to see them)

As you can see we can have our policies address violations at different stages of an app lifecycle. In our case, it's already running so we cannot choose to enforce on build or deploy (we'd need a new policy for that) but we can enforce on runtime. Then we can restart the deployment and have the policy address it.

Slide the toggle for Runtime:

Review the rest of the options, but leave them all as is for this exercise.

Choose *Save* to save the policy.

== Seeing the results of our policy

Check to see what the deployment is doing:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get deployments -n candleco
----

Still running.

Let's find the images pod so we can stop it.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl get pods -n candleco
----

You'll see a pod with a name like `candleco-images-deployment-64fd964b75-kzxmv `

Let's kill it and then watch what happens. Run the following command using the correct naming for your pod:

[source,shell]
----
kubectl delete pod candleco-images-deployment-64fd964b75-kzxmv -n candleco; kubectl get pods -n candleco --watch
----

You should see the container try and restart (that's what it's set to do) and then ... voila, get terminated. That's ACS doing it's thing!

Isn't it great!!!?

(as always, CTRL-C gets you out of the watch)

== View this in ACS

Return to ACS and go to the Violations dialog. You'll notice the "Enforced" section for the myEKS/candleco violation now reflects what you saw on the CLI:

image::task8-i.png[task8-i]

Click on the link and check out the "Enforcement" tab:

image::task8-j.png[task8-j]

Follow the links to learn more.

== Bonus

You may have noticed this is also running on your ROSA cluster. Your Cloud 9 environment has an oc client on it. See if you remediate the process on there, too!.

Hint: You can get login token for your CLI in ROSA from and choosing "Copy login command" and then logging in and selecting "Display Token":

image::task8-k.png[task8-k]

Just copy the oc login line and run this on your Cloud9 CLI:

As before, look for the deployment:

[source,shell]

Find the pod:

[source,shell]
----
oc get pods -n candleco | grep candleco-images-deployment 
----

And delete the pod:

[source,shell]
----
oc delete pod candleco-images-deployment-6db8fdf68d-rtz9p -n candleco; oc get pods -n candleco --watch
----

Et voila! The policy has kicked in and secured ROSA. 

As you can see, using ACS with EKS, ROSA, and any compliant K8s distro is a snap! Time to go sell some flowery candles!
