= Monitor Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) with ACS

After you finish the scans of EKS and ROSA you find out from one of your dev teams that CandleCo also uses AWS Elastic Container Registry to manage their images.

And you're in luck! ACS CS can be intergated into ECR to monitor images there, so let's do that now!

To do this you're going to connect CandleCo's ECR to your ACS CS instance and scan the images they have in there.

== Get environment details

* You need to gather a few details, such as your ECR registry ID, AWS Region, and the key and secret key for the precreated AWS ECR user to use with this task.

* Follow the steps below on your Cloud9 instance to get record the values.

* Get your registry ID and images:

[source,shell]
----
$ aws ecr describe-repositories --query "repositories[].[registryId]" --output text | uniq
$ aws ecr describe-repositories --query "repositories[].[repositoryUri]" --output text
----

* Get your region

[source,shell]
----
$ echo $AWS_REGION
----

* Review the access keys for AWS Environment

AWS Access Key: { aws_access_key_id }
AWS Secret Access Key: { aws_secret_access_key }

== Connect ACS CS and ECR

* Next up, you need to integrate RHACS and ECR. Do this via the RHACS console's "Integrations" section.

* Go to the RHACS console and choose Platform Configration > Integrations and find the AWS Amazon ECR tile:

* Choose the "New integration" button

* Fill out the form with the details you retrieved above.

*NOTE: Leave the Endpoint field blank as RHACS constructs the endpoint from info you are providing.*

* Add the Access key ID and Secret Access key you retrieved from the Jam console in the steps above.

_Tip: Choose "Test" to check the configuration, you should see a green success confirmation._

* Choose "Save" to save the integration.

== Monitor the images in ECR with ACS CS

* Once RHACS and ECR are integrated you need to monitor your images. To monitor an image to RHACS you need to create a watch.

* In RHACS go to Vulnerability Management (1.0) > Dashboard and choose the "Images" header

* From the next screen choose "Manage Watches"

* Add all the images you retrieved on the Cloud9 console above to be watched.

* Once all images are added choose "Close"

* Your images are now visible in the list and are being scanned. Try exploring them.

*RHACS is now successfully integrated with ECR.*

== Explore image scanning

* With RHACS you can dig into an image and see security analysis components inside your image.

* There is an example of a vulnerable image you can find. Click on a row containing the candleco-images image:

* This will open a page showing the details of the image:

* Look for things like the "Top riskiest image components" tile and more!
