= Monitor an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Cloud Service

Now that your Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Cloud Service (RHACS CS) is up and running it's time to connect it to CandleCo's Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) deployment.

You do this by deploying a RHACS "agent" to your EKS cluster which can report back to RHACS.

This agent runs a few small processes on the cluster.

== Logging into your environment

For the lab you have access to an AWS environment containing EKS and ECR. This is the CandleCo environment. To make things easy you'll also have a Cloud9 environment providing you a CLI for all the tasks. 

The details for your environment are below:

      AWS Console User Name: { eks_cluster_aws_web_console_user_name }
      AWS Console Password: { eks_cluster_aws_web_console_password }
      AWS Account ID: { eks_cluster_aws_account_id }
      AWS Cloud9 URL: { eks_cluster_aws_cloud9_url }

 }}"

Simply open the Cloud9 URL and provide the AWS authentication details when prompted.

_Note: You also have a ROSA environment as well and those details are provided in a later module._

== Prep Cloud9

First, you need to run the environment prep script on the Cloud9 CLI.

_IMPORTANT: This installs essentials tools and files for this challenge so please don't skip it!_

[source,shell]
----
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/augustrh/rhsummit2024/main/acs-jam-c9-prep-summit.sh
$ source acs-jam-c9-prep-summit.sh
----

*Now on to the challenge!*

== Create ACS API Token

This token allows you to authenticate with ACS via the API and is helpful to use in automating the process of adding clusters for montoring.

* You'll find your RHACS instance in the https://console.redhat.com/application-services/acs/instances[Red Hat Console,window=_blank]
* Once there, you'll see the instance you created in the list (it's likely the only one). Click on the instance's name:

image::task3-1.png[task3-1]

This leads you to the instance's information panel. 

* There you can click on the blue "Open ACS Console" button to open the console.
* You will also find important "Instance Details" showing you the specific details of your instance as well as the Central API endpoint (Sensor mTLS) and Central instance (UI, roxctl) values.

== Generate an API token

* After logging into the ACS UI go to Platform Configuration > Integrations > Authentication Tokens and choose API Token:

image::task3-3.png[task3-3]

* Choose Generate Token

* Name the token and set the Role to Admin

image::task3-4.png[task3-4]

Choose Generate and be sure to copy and record the output. *You will need this token later and it cannot be regenerated.*

== Create a Red Hat Service Account and get its token

Login to the https://access.redhat.com/terms-based-registry/[Red Hat console] and create a service account.

* You'll need this to retrieve the RHACS images from the Red Hat registry with your Red Hat credentials.

* Choose *New Service Account* and use the name *acsjam2023*. You'll need *both* the numbers and the name for future steps:

image::task3-6.png[task3-6]

* Click *Create*

* Retrieve the token:

image::task3-7.png[task3-7]

* And copy it!

image::task3-8.png[task3-8]

_Be sure to record the full username (remember, this includes the numbers, the pipe, and the name!) and the token._

== Create an ACS Init Bundle

* In the ACS UI go to *Platform Configurations > Integrations > Cluster Init Bundle*:

image::task3-9.png[task3-9]

* Choose *Generate bundle*

* Name the bundle "ekscluster" (*please don't change this name and use as show here*):

image::task3-10.png[task3-10]

* And choose Generate

* On the Create Integration choose the *Download Helm values file* option:

image::task3-11.png[task3-11]

* This will download a file named *ekscluster-cluster-init-bundle.yaml*. Keep track of it! ;)

* Now, download the Kubernetes secrets file by selecting *Download Kubernetes secrets file*. Save this file locally as well!

== Upload the ACS init bundle to Cloud9

* From Cloud9 choose File > Upload Local Files:

image::task3-12.png[task3-12]

* And select the file you just downloaded:

image::task3-13.png[task3-13]

* You will use it in a future step.

== Deploy the ACS agent to EKS

* Create a namespace for the ACS agent to run in.

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl create namespace stackrox
----

* Create a secret that uses the Red Hat Console service account's token:
** You need to replace *12345678|RHSA* with the full name for your service account. This includes the number, the pipe, and the name.
** You need to replace **RHSA_TOKEN** with the service account token from above. This is NOT the ACS API token.
** The command will look something like this:

image::task3-14.png[task3-14]

_TIP: Use the below command and make your substitutions a little easier:_

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry redhatreg --docker-server=registry.redhat.io --docker-username="**12345678|RHSA**" --docker-password="**RHSA_TOKEN**" -n stackrox
----

* Add the official ACS helm chart to deploy the ACS sensor to EKS.

[source,shell]
----
$ helm repo add rhacs https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/rhacs/charts/
----

* Install the agent from the bundle with the helm chart, secret, and init bundle (ekscluster-cluster-init-bundle.yaml)

* To do this you need to replace the ACS_ID shown in the sample below with the actual ACS ID of your instance.

* You can find this value in the ACS instance's information panel in the Red Hat Console.

_TIP: Find your instance in the https://console.redhat.com/application-services/acs/instances[Red Hat console], choose your instance's name, and find the panel to locate the ID_

* The instance name is a series of randomised letters and number that you can copy/paste from the console easily; it looks something like this:

image::task3-15.png[task3-15]

_TIP: Use the below command and make your substitutions a little easier:_

[source,shell]
----
$ helm install -n stackrox stackrox-secured-cluster-services rhacs/stackrox-secured-cluster-services -f ekscluster-cluster-init-bundle.yaml --set clusterName=myEKS --set imagePullSecrets.useExisting=redhatreg --set centralEndpoint=https://acs-data-**ACS_ID**.acs.rhcloud.com:443 -f sensor-jam.yaml
----

_NOTE: You may have noticed the -f sensor-jam.yaml flag on the helm install. That is simply to reduce the CPU and Memory limits for the ACS sensor due to limitations in the Lab environment._

* Ensure the pods and deployments start up properly:

[source,shell]
----
$ kubectl get pods -n stackrox
$ kubectl get deployment -n stackrox
----

*All should be running after 1-2 minutes.*

== View your new cluster in ACS!

Phew! You made it!

On ACS go to Platform Configuration > Clusters and view the EKS deployment.

Nice one!
