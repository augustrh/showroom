= View a vulnerability in an image 

Now that we've connected RHACS CS and ECR we can look deep into the images in our repositories.

== The Vulnerability dashboard

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes (RHACS) Dashboard provides quick access to the data you need. Let's check out the Images section and dive into a candleco image for review.

Go to Vulnerability Management (1.0) > Dashboard and click on the images box:

image::task7-a.png[task7-a]

Here you'll see all the images we are monitoring _across all our clusters_. So you'll see OpenShift and more in there as well as the ECR images we inherited from Candelco.

Let's look at only the candleco in their registries. In the filter box look for "Image Registry" and enter the registry name of your environment.

Hint: You can find that with the following command from Cloud9

[source,shell]
----
aws ecr describe-repositories --query "repositories[].[repositoryUri]" --output text | awk -F "/" '/1/ {print $1}' | uniq
----

image::task7-b.png[task7-b]

Notice the "Image Status" column shows both Inactive and Active images. The inactive images are included because of the Watches we created in the last task.

Click on the candleco-cart:latest image:

As you can see there are a lot of issues with this image.

Click on the struts reference in the "Top riskiest components" panel:

image::task7-c.png[task7-c]

Here we can dig even deeper. RHACS CS has found the component version, the location of the problem inside the image, and even offers information about which version is needed to fix it.

image::task7-d.png[task7-d]

Clicking on the list of CVE's for the image yields even more info. Including links to the full CVE and more.

image::task7-e.png[task7-e]

Spend some time exploring the affected images in both ROSA and EKS. You'll quickly see how much information RHACS CS can gather for you across your hybrid cloud!
